Coherence. Good movie. Will absolutely make your brain hurt. 

 ===*=== 

Synecdoche, New York. 

 ===*=== 

Videodrome - David Cronenberg at his best, most screwed up.. And still as viable today as when it was made.

Long live the new flesh!

 ===*=== 

Brasil

 ===*=== 

Moon

 ===*=== 

Paprika or anything from Satoshi-Kon

 ===*=== 

Primer.

On third viewing there are still things I feel like I only like 60% get.

 ===*=== 

Primal Fear

 ===*=== 

Oldboy (Korean version)

 ===*=== 

The Machinist with Christian Bale is a good one.

 ===*=== 

Twelve Monkeys

 ===*=== 

Mulholland Drive.

 ===*=== 

The Game.

 ===*=== 

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. The mindfuckery is done very well. It tells you your mind will be fucked so you think you'll be able to handle it and then it just happens anyway

 ===*=== 

Predestination

 ===*=== 

Seven. It's a thriller/horror movie that had me bewildered and on the edge of my seat the entire time.  

 ===*=== 

The Truman Show. (not sure why it hasn't been mentioned yet o.o) It mind fucked people so hard, there's a syndrome named after it 

 ===*=== 

Recently, arrival was quite good.

 ===*=== 

The End of Evangelion.

 ===*=== 

A Scanner Darkly

http://imdb.com/title/tt0405296/

Edit: [My favorite scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seP2DPqd0o8)

 ===*=== 

Memento.

 ===*=== 

Shutter Island had a good aha moment that didn't spin out of control. Enjoyable film. 

 ===*=== 

Frailty 

 ===*=== 

Jacobs Ladder

 ===*=== 

Inland Empire. 

Fucking weird as shit David Lynch movie. 

 ===*=== 

The first Saw movie.

That ending, holy shit.



 ===*=== 

The Prestige. 

That one really messed with me, thinking about the repercussions of doing the water trick every night... 

 ===*=== 

Black Mirror on Netflix is pretty awesome. 

 ===*=== 

Waking Life.

It's entirely rotoscoped to a really trippy effect and it's about a guy walking through several dreams and having conversations with people about deep philosophical things. For example there's a couple discussing that life may be the vibrant memories of someone dying. There's so many little details and symbolism that you can watch it ten times and still find something new. 

Also Mr. Nobody. It's on Netflix, I don't know why it isn't more well known. Jared Leto plays the last mortal looking back on his life in which he could see the outcome of every decision. Trippy and beautiful as fuck.

 ===*=== 

Ex Machina

 ===*=== 

Fight club 

 ===*=== 

The Matrix ?

 ===*=== 

* Antichrist

* Enemy

* Under the Skin

 ===*=== 

2001 A Space Odyssey

 ===*=== 

Naked lunch. It's about a guy injecting bug powder and then type writers that are also big bugs tell him to embrace being gay and also to complete an unexplained mission for he is their agent. It's super weird and really well done!

 ===*=== 

Circle

Extremely under-rated and is on Netflix!

 ===*=== 

un chien andalou

 ===*=== 

Eraserhead 

Jacobs Ladder

Blade Runner

Donnie Darko

Oldboy

Fear and Loathing 

The Butterfly Effect (with the original ending, not the happy one)

The Ninth Gate 

Mr. Nobody 

Inception

Edit: My friend pointed about to me that I could add Requiem for a Dream to this list, but I think that movie is just depressing as fuck.

 ===*=== 

Maybe not mind-fuck films in the new sense that a single plot twist can "fuck" your mind up, but these certainly will have intercourse with your brains. 

The Holy Mountain/El Topo/Fando y Lis/okay, just everything by Jodorowsky.

The Alphabet, an early short by David Lynch.

The Devils, by Ken Russell. 

Salo, or 120 Days of Sodom.

The Untold Story.

EDIT: Adding some more I thought of since posting...

Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance/Lady Vengeance (the other two of the Vengeance Trilogy that Oldboy belongs to, I prefer the former--it's a sad, sad movie)

Prisoners (Denis Villeneuve is just awesome)

Heavy Traffic (or Ralph Bakshi animation in general)

 ===*=== 

The Holy Mountain.

When a director goes a week without sleeping, drops acid, and gives the actors magic mushrooms, you know the movie's gonna get weird.

 ===*=== 

I just finished watching Akira. I would say it counts as a "mind fuck" film.

 ===*=== 

John Dies At The End

 ===*=== 

Vanilla Sky, Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind, Shutter Island

 ===*=== 

Enter the Void. You will never forget it!
