I was a TA in an after school tutoring program at a public school back in the late 90s. I noticed one girl ("Stacy")  right away (7 yo) who was only allowed to use the restroom with supervision, and the restroom had to be empty of all other kids. On my first day I was helping her and she was scooting around in her seat a lot, and she said "my cunt itches."  I thought it was very odd so I asked about her, and holy crap I will never forget it. Stacy was born to a 13 year old girl who was raped by her father, and the dad/grandfather molested her as a baby as well. When she was young her mom started bringing men home for prostitution purposes.  The mom would service men with her daughter laying in bed next to her, and it was pretty much a given that Stacy was molested by those men as well. Her mom also smoked heroin with her daughter next to her. She was taken by CPS and was in foster care when I taught her.
This poor kid would attempt to molest other little girls in the bathroom and scream sexually explicit phrases at any given times. She would masturbate and pee everywhere in the bathroom if not supervised.
This poor girl was kicked out of every foster home for acting out sexually. Finally they found a lady who was a social worker who dealt with juvenile gang members- she was tough as nails. Nothing scared her. She agreed to take Stacy in. Slowly we began to see the sexual agression stopping, she stopped wetting her pants, and the yelling obscenities stopped. She still had to be supervised around other girls and in the bathroom but she began playing appropriately. 6 months after Stacy got her new foster mom, she was reading and writing and acting almost like a kid her age. Speaking to her foster mom one day she said that she has begun the process to adopt Stacy, and if she could get through the school year without another behavioral issue, she would be adopted. I had to leave to go to college so I wasn't there to see it, but my old boss emailed me and said that the adoption had been finalized,  and they moved to another state so Stacy wouldn't keep getting flash backs from the old places. 
I desperately wish I knew how she'd turned out.

I'm a technology teacher (design and make). I had an 11 year old student who was terrible at using scissors and couldn't thread a needle. She had very high grades academically but something didn't seem quite right.

I recommended she receive special assistance and a referral, and it turns out after testing that she had very little spatial awareness and almost no hand-eye coordination. After calling the parents in we found that her mother was paralyzed and in a wheelchair (only dad had come to parent interviews  etc), and dad was very busy working to support them both, so no one had ever played any physical games or activities with her. She hadn't developed in this area, and was intelligent enough to hide these short comings in previous school activities. 

Not a difficult fix (lots of time doing crafts, throwing and catching balls, that kind of thing needed), but something that could have really held her back in the future.

I had a teacher tell tell us (the  entire classroom) that she doesn't send letters or notes home regarding a students behavior because she once had a student come back the next day with bruises.

My mom worked at my elementary during and after my stay there. She worked as a teachers aid and would help out during lunch. While I was in middle school she told me about a little girl who came to lunch every day with a crummy smushed sandwich and nothing else to eat. Her brother on the other hand would get a more acceptable lunch. She said that the first few times they noticed it they would offer milk and fruit to her but the brother would just take it away from her so they had to start waiting for him to finish his own lunch and go outside for recess before they could feed her. I don't know what happened with her after that though, but I felt so much anger at that snot nosed brat. What the fuck was wrong with that family that even the brother was putting down that little girl?

My mom had a kid who came from a VERY broken home. I can't remember specifics, but he was raised by his Grandmother due to his mother and father being incarcerated. He's given my mother some hell by being violent towards other students, violent towards her and other teachers, and even showing violence towards administrators. During centers, the kids are divided up and my mom has a group with her including this child. They read a story about a dog, and my mom used that to segue into some comprehension questions concerning the story. The topic of pets is brought up, and the boy mentions that his sister's rabbit died earlier in the year and that he was the one who killed the rabbit. My mother gets a bit concerned, and asks the boy if it was on accident, and he replies that it wasn't and that he choked the rabbit until it stopped breathing. 

My mom quickly had to push the topic to something else because the other kids in the centers' group were noticeably uncomfortable (including herself). My mother began the process to put him into an alternative school for students with emotional/behavioral difficulties, but his mother got out of jail and moved him along with his siblings to Florida just before he was set to begin that school.

I had a kid my first or second year-- so this was 1995-96-- who was pretty scary. I teach English, btw. He was just an asshole; had an excuse for everything, tried to bully other kids, when we had discussions about literature he wanted to derail the conversation into weird territory... hard to explain, but the kid was just off. 

At parent conference time, mom came in, and I was careful to say some positive things. Him derailing conversations because "creativity," for example. Mom cried and told me no one had ever said anything positive about her kid, before me. She even wrote me a thank you note. I also covered the aspects of his behavior that concerned me, of course. 

Anyway, after high school he got arrested for theft, drugs, and assault and spent some time in jail. He committed suicide before he was 30.

I work in an inner-city school in an under-resourced neighborhood. There are so many red flags every week, I couldn't count them all. One little boy stands out to me though. I greet the kids as they come into school every morning, and one day I noticed a man and a child walking across the lawn to our door slowly, the man getting in the child's face a few times. Finally they reach the door, and the man practically hands his son to me, saying "can you make sure he gets to his classroom? He just tried running away from me a minute ago." I was speechless, but I took the kid, who was quietly tearful, and brought him into the building. I was trying to ask him who's class he was in so I could take him to his room, but he wouldn't talk to me. Finally he said "I don't want to go home ever again" just as I was getting him through the door, and another teacher stepped in and swept him away, telling him "we haven't seen you in weeks! Don't cry, we don't do that here!" I know she meant well, but I could tell that it had taken a lot for that kid to say what he did, and I didn't know if he would share that with anyone else. I told the school social worker and can only hope that he's being taken care of now.

That boy broke my heart.

A bit different from some of the others, but I once taught a class of 30 "at risk" 4th graders. They were getting supplementary math lessons, as they were failing their regular math class, and it was rough. It was one of those schools where they have metal detectors at every entrance. On multiple occasions I broke up rather impressive fights. Without conventional weapons, they were really ingenious. One kid once ripped out the three ring part of the three ring binders and attacked another student's forearm with it. Really creative, but obviously not great behavior. I was an untrained and unqualified teacher (I was supposed to be designing after school program curriculum, not teaching). I actually completely missed the "red flag". 

One kid, I'll call him Darron, was really well behaved. I never had to say anything to get him to sit down, stop hitting other students, stop throwing things, or any of a number of disruptive activities going on in the classroom. In fact, he never did much at all. He spent most of the time dozing off or barely listening, leaning forward and resting his head in his hands. I didn't think anything of it, as the rest of the class was so much for disruptive and destructive, I was spending most of my time and energy just keeping them under control.

Well Darron was quiet and sleepy during class because his house burned down at the start of the school year. The fire killed his grandma (who raised him) and his dog. He was sent to live with his cousins, 12 people who lived in a very small house with nowhere close to enough bedrooms to be legally occupied the way it was. Darron had been depressed and having problems sleeping (sharing a room with his cousins) for the entire year by the time I found out what happened. I learned on the last day of school. 

I'm sorry I didn't know, Darron. I'm sorry I didn't notice you were having problems.

Had a high school student who was a well-known white supremist wear a bulletproof vest to school one day. Quietly called administration to come take him from class. His father complained "Where in the dress code does it say he can't wear a bulletproof vest?" That was a big red flag. Later that year kid was expelled for extorting money from other kids by threatening them with a screwdriver. A year later that student got shot in the face and lost his entire nose, and he's now in prison.

I had a student ask me if I had any old glasses frames she could have, because hers broke. I knew she was in the foster care system, so I asked her why her foster mom couldn't get her some new ones. She told me that her foster mom said she could only get new frames every four years, which made her sad because her real daughter had just gotten a second set of frames that year. I had noticed several other things (the student asked me if I had any extra female hygiene supplies so she could have some at night, so I sent her to the nurse to get extras) that seemed like they should have been covered by the state. I reported this, and it turned out that the foster mom was clearly not providing basic necessities for either of her foster kids. I was really glad I went with my gut. 

EDIT: and yes, I found some glasses frames for her. 

DOUBLE EDIT: Wow, thank you for the gold. I was not expecting that! You all have been so kind. I'm sure most people would have done what I did, I just happened to have a connection with the student so she felt comfortable letting me in a little bit. The CPS worker is the hero in this story!

I worked in an elementary school for a while, and spent a good couple months of that working as a one-on-one aid for a new kid who was very defiant with undiagnosed anger problems. He'd bully the kids who go out of their way to befriend him, the rest of the class resented his interruptions to the classroom. We tried several variations of positive reinforcement strategies but nothing sticked. We couldn't figure him out. He wasn't very well liked at school, didn't seem to get a ton of attention at home but his siblings at another school were normal. My job an aid was to basically keep him on track (i.e. keep him organized and correct him when he misbehaved - which was constantly) and be with him at all time, which he understandably resented. He'd try to get to me through physical threats (usually with pencils) and comments like: "I hate you", "X of yours is ugly", "you'll never be a teacher", etc.. Teachers in the lounge remarked that he seemed like the type of kid who'd shoot up public places someday. We all wondered what could have happened in his short life to make him this way.

One day I corrected him on the playground at recess and he went into his pocked and removed a 4 in. long, pointy, lock pick, held it up a bit, and glared at me. The glares were typical but the event was especially chilling because it showed an escalation in behavior -  premeditation (taking it to school when he knew such objects were not allowed) and intent (flashing it at me in a moment of anger). I reacted firmly and he ran up the playground equipment, and I calmly talked him down, eventually convincing him to show me what he had. Honestly (and this is fucked up) I was relieved he did this because it was finally some solid evidence to administration that I was in over my head. I was emotionally spent. Some days were so bad that I was hoping he'd stab me so I'd have grounds for not working with him anymore, or at the very least, maybe go home early. I told the teacher immediately after recess and she was nonplussed, didn't tell any superiors (no idea if she told the psychologist), and simply confiscated the lock pick. A few days later I was moved for unrelated reasons. He got a new aid who was instructed to give him more space (I suggested this approach earlier and it was dismissed!) and he seemed to be doing a little better. No longer with the school, I hope he got the intervention he needs. If he doesn't, he's going to be one scary adult. If I ever run into him, I hope he doesn't remember me. 

Edit: a word

This isn't exactly a red flag so much as a full on explosion but I'll never forget the lessons I learned. 

I used to run a camp at a zoo. We had some "scholarship" kids and their home life seemed pretty rough. (I also drove the van to go get them sometimes)  I had this one kid in particular who was really tough to deal with. Bigger than the other kids by a fair margin, had lots of anger issues, etc. two stories about him: we'll calm him J. 

The first story was that I witnessed him haul off and smack this other kid that he knew (they were both in the same program and even lived in the same complex) I took him aside to have a chat with him and asked him: "j, what's a better way you could have dealt with that?" I was thinking, "walk away, go tell an adult, etc, etc..." he literally couldn't think of a single thing other than to just hit her. Made me realize that's probably just how things are resolved in his home. Still makes me sad. 

The second story was that I worked with him the first day of camp and struggled with him in my group. I found myself being pretty controlling/discipline focused with him because I just couldn't handle him otherwise.  So I decided to try him in another group with a male leader-figured maybe that would go better. So the second day, he was with our male leader-that didn't go well either. The third day of camp, I tried him with our remaining leader and I don't think he even lasted the day. So, I took him aside and asked him to pick who he wanted to spend the rest of the week with. I figured he wouldn't pick me because I had been so "hard" on him earlier in the week but I wanted to give this kid at least one decision he got to make himself. Lo and behold, he picked me. The rest of camp wasn't a cake walk but we managed. I've never forgotten him.

Nota bene: I worked in a school for seriously emotionally disturbed children as an intern so this is from the red flag already noticed department:

- 8 year old with his own giant bodyguard who followed him around to protect other children from him. He was dangerous.

- 7 year old who had never spoken one word due to abuse. 

- 8 year old with one leg shorter than the other due to mother breaking it when he was an infant and no medical attention.

-7 year old who constantly tried to molest other kids because that was the only love he'd known.

That was my entire classroom.  These kids broke my heart every day that they persevered and kept trying to learn and yet had no real future ahead of them (yes there are miracles but these kids wouldn't see to many of those).
Worst mistake I ever made was deciding to pursue my original career rather than go into SED teaching. Very, very rewarding work.

You know when a young person learns how to curse, they don't inflect the sentence correctly and it just sounds wrong? "Wtf?" becomes "what THE Fuck?"... just sounds weird.

About 3 momths ago, We were just having a conversation about his college application and he just said, "yeah, well if I don't get into MIT I guess I'll just kill myself." It's didn't sound like a joke
 It just sounded wrong. Like he inflected it incorrectly. It threw me off. I scolded him, "hey dude, easy. Don't joke about that stuff."

This passed Tuesday he committed suicide. We loved that kid. He was an adult in a 17 year old's body. I'll never forgive myself for not seeing that.

I work at a gymnastics place. I work with a group of 2nd/3rd grade girls. 
At the beginning of the year, it was fine, she was really happy, cheerful, got along with everyone. Then one day, she didn't come. Didn't think too much of it, kids are absent a lot. I hardly ever have a full class. But one day turned to two. Then three. Eventually, a week went by when she finally showed up, at least physically. 
She looked emotionally drained. Like she couldn't walk 5 feet without giving up. She didn't wanna be there, so I told her she should call her folks at home to see if they can come get her. Big mistake, she went off, saying how I didn't want her there, and that she thought that I thought it "was the best week since I wasn't here." Then she went to the bathroom. I couldn't go in there(I'm a guy) so the female teacher went in to being her out. We went into a back room, and asked her if she was okay, to which she started crying. She told me that at the beginning of the year, she was living with her grandparents, hence why she was happy all the time. Then they suddenly died in a car crash while she was at gymnastics. I was horrified. But that's not the end. She said the reason she was living with them was because her parents would abuse her and force her to do shit she didn't want to, so they would beat her.
Now, I've seen things that should make me cry. My grandmother and grandfather have both passed(on both sides). One of my close friends died to cancer when I was in middle school. It was tough. But the story she told me, it ranks right up there with it. I was about to cry myself. No child should have to endure this type of thing. 
 So the grandfather took her away and brought her out of that life, until they left. It was sickening. After about 45 minutes of talking about it, I convinced her we call the police. She was sent to counseling. 
I never heard from her again. I never heard of what happened to her or the parents, granted this happened 2 months ago. I'm hoping one day she'll walk in and I'll see her, happy as she was when I first met her. 
EDIT: so a lot of people have asked me to edit or reply if/when she comes back. I'll be sure to do that! Hopes are high.

I'll start by saying that the student in my story was Seung-Hui Cho, the infamous Virginia Tech shooter - who killed 32 people.

I'm not the professor in this story, but I did speak to Dr. Nikki Giovanni at length about him (she brought it up frequently with her students), and I'll retell it on her behalf.

Cho was one of her students, and he displayed red flags all over the place. Dr. Giovanni taught poetry, and Cho was briefly in her intro course. He was menacing and dark, and would write poems involving the deaths of the *other* students in class.

Eventually, the other students would stop coming to class because of him. He was grim and serious, and he made people uncomfortable - and Dr. Giovanni thought he might actually hurt someone. 

She was the one person who insisted that the school make him get help, but they pushed back and said they couldn't *make* anyone get mental help, it had to be up to the student or the student's parents.

Dr. Giovanni then delivered an ultimatum to the department, stating that Cho had to be removed from her class or she would step down. For those who don't know her, [Nikki Giovanni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Giovanni) is a *very* distinguished professor, a famous civil rights poet, and overall a very sweet and kind person.

Since the school didn't want to lose her, they caved and cut Cho from her class. She was really disturbed by him, and when she found out about the shooting (she wasn't on campus that day), she immediately knew it was Cho.

It's tough to assign blame in a situation like that, but she knew he needed help and he wasn't getting it.

I have a 7th grade student this year who bugged the hell out of me. He was "that kid" - he smelled bad, was disrespectful and disruptive, and generally made life miserable for us. 

Then, we found out about his background. At a young age, his mother tried to kill him several times. She got drunk and chased him with a knife, and he only escaped by locking himself into the bathroom. She tried to drown him. She used to put out cigarettes on him. 

Currently, he lives with his alcoholic father who obviously hates the kid. He told me the other day that he spent the weekend going to AA meetings with both of his parents. 

I've made it a point to be kind to him now. I take a minute every day to talk with him and praise every positive action I see. I hope to make school something positive for him, because I can only imagine the hell he goes home to.

I'm late to the thread so this will probably get buried, but I'll post anyway. 

A few years ago I volunteered to mentor kids in this program for low-income "at risk" kids. Twice a week we took them to The Boys &amp; Girls club, fed them dinner, and did activities with them in small groups. We didn't have enough adults for one-on-one attention, but it was 2-3 kids per adult. We ate dinner with the kids and just paid attention to them.

I got assigned to the youngest girls in the group. Katie, a 4-year-old still in preschool, looked like a living cabbage patch doll with chubby cheeks and dimples. Katie was very sweet, but I quickly found out that she was a chronic liar. 

Every time I saw Katie she'd have a new wildly impossible story. She told stories about surviving fires, about going on trips, and about finding magical places. It all sounded like things she'd seen on TV. Sometimes her stories didn't even make sense. One day she'd talk about her mommy being sick in the hospital, and the next she'd be talking about her mommy taking her to a theme park. One time she told me she was an only child. A few weeks later, she had brothers and sisters. It was all a bit confusing and unbelievable, but kids that age lie a lot so I didn't worry about it much. 

Then one night, right before Christmas, Katie didn't greet me with her usual dimpled smile. She had obviously been crying, so I asked her what was wrong. 

"My mommy died," she said. 

I immediately assumed she was lying. It was the weirdest lie she'd told so far, but not too far off from the other things like her house burning down. But then Katie showed me the piece of paper she was clutching. It was the program from a woman's funeral. 

A bit panicked, I found the program director and asked him what the fuck was going on with this kid. 

"Oh yeah, her mom died last week. The funeral was on Sunday," the director said, like it was no big deal. 

So I went back to Katie and just tried to figure out how the fuck to help this 4 year old navigate the death of her mother. I figured she needed some normalcy in her life, so we ate dinner together and tried to go through the usual routine. When it was time to play games, Katie refused. She sat in my lap and asked me to read the funeral program over and over again, so I did. 

Later I found out that only about half of the things Katie had told me were lies. She did like to make up stories, but she was doing it to cope with a seriously fucked up life. Her mom had been dying of cancer for the last year, and no one in the program bothered to fill me in on that even though the director knew that was why she was with us. The reason her family situation was so confusing was that she was in foster care and she was calling both her mom and her foster mom "Mommy". She told me she was an only child one week and then talked about brothers and sisters the next week because she had gone to a foster home with other children. 

I felt like shit for not believing her. I'm still mad at the program director for not mentioning that the kid's mom was dying.

 ===*=== 

I worked at an elementary school for a few years and there was this kid I swore was a sociopath. He was very smart and manipulative, but he also gave me the creeps. He would often find ways to hurt kids by getting other children to do his dirty work. He was so good at spinning this manipulative web of lies, that the children would blame each other, leaving him completely out of it. Even when he was caught red handed (which wasn't often), he would deny it. For whatever reason the principal had a soft spot for him, so he never got in trouble for anything that he did and the principal saw him as the victim. I won't be surprised in the slightest if I see that kid in the news some day for killing people and\or hurting people in some way. 

Edit: When I mean they kept him out of it, he would report some behavior to us and be very involved in the situation, but then the kids not wanting to get on his bad side would deny he had any involvement in what had happened. If this happened once or twice, I would have chalked it up to normal kid tattling, but this happened a lot and he always seemed to be the one in the middle, but always denied being the one who started it. 

Edit: I know a lot of people are asking for specifics, but for privacy reasons I have kept it as vague as possible. However I can tell you that I was not the only staff member who felt this way. I know there are also a lot of you who say he sounds like a future businessman or politician, however the times where he was caught, he was physically hurting other students. He would punch and kick them, not to mention the many, many mind games he liked to inflict on the other students. There was one other red flag where for one assignment he wrote about how he was happy his dog died. That got shown to a counselor and I'm not sure if anything happened after that, but I doubt it.

I was teaching Freshman English. There was a very good student, female, 23 or so. Really bright and engaged. Frankly, it was nice to have someone other than 18-year-olds in the class. She consistently participated and was the best part of the class for me personally. And then one day, she stopped coming. Two weeks went by. Not a peep. It isn't uncommon for students to put off dropping a class until the deadline, so while I was disappointed, I wasn't concerned. Then she showed up, apologizing for missing so much time. By rule, she'd already failed the class, but I sensed something was awry, so I worked with her on a schedule to complete the work she'd missed. And then she missed those deadlines and begged for more extensions. I asked her what was up, and she burst into tears and told me that her boyfriend had beaten the crap out of her. She showed me the bruises on her arms and legs. It was awful. Of course, I talked her into letting me call the police and I sent her to university-provided counseling.

It got worse. I asked the asshole department-chair what to do about her grade. He ordered me to kick her out of my class. "Oh god, anything but that," I pleaded. But he was firm. If I didn't kick her out, he would. "You're not doing her any favors by letting her fail," he said. And so, in one of the hardest conversations I will ever have, I told her to withdraw so I didn't have to fail her. You cannot even imagine my guilt, especially when she sobbed that she would lose her financial aid and have to drop out of school entirely. What do you even say to that? But the deed was done. She dropped all of her classes and disappeared from the university altogether, as promised.

A few years later, I was working a soulless corporate job in another city. My old English department secretary emailed me and told me a former student was trying to contact me. It was her. She'd finally finished school, and she wanted to let me know. It was a moment of pure joy. And to give the guy his due, the department chair had been absolutely right. 

**Edit for clarity:** in retrospect, the student herself thought that he was right. She had Ws on her record instead of certain Fs, which means her GPA was unaffected by her personal downward spiral. Plus instead of failing school, she attended to her problems in therapy. That, she considered a huge win. She expressed gratitude to me for kicking her down this path, which is why I'm giving some credit to the guy who made me do it.

I taught in an autism classroom for elementary age students. I had one student with autism who I suspected had some sort of schizophrenia as well. He would obsessively watch videos of fatal accidents or death scenes from movies like Final Destination, and then work himself up into a massive ball of anxiety thinking about those scenes. His parents were both affluent lawyers who didn't really have time to raise him, so they'd do stupid shit like forget to give him his ADHD meds one day, and then give him a double or triple dose the next day.

He started having episodes in 5th grade where he would think he was in one of those videos. He'd scream about his bones being on fire, saying he could feel his skin burning. One afternoon, he snapped and started running around the room screaming he was in a burning subway. He attacked me and one of my assistants, so we had to restrain him and put him in the isolation room. Once he calmed down, he started crying because he felt so bad about attacking us.

I tried raising my concerns with the parents, but they wouldn't hear it. I tried calling CPS for medical neglect of a severe mental health condition, but my principal wouldn't let me because he was afraid the parents would sue. After I left that job, I heard he got expelled for pointing a fake gun at another kid and saying "I'm going to blow your fucking head off." This was a few days after the Sandy Hook shooting. His parents petitioned the expulsion, saying his behavior was a result of his autism and the school district backed off.

I keep documents of all of my attempts to warn people about this kid, in case he does something awful someday. The sad thing is, he was a really sweet kid underneath all of his mental health issues. I hope he gets help.

It depends on what kind of "red flags" you are talking about. I've seen flags for home abuse, sexual abuse, malnutrition, neglect, un-diagnosed mental illness or learning disorders. We're mandatory reporters, so our only option is to tell an authority (usually an administrator) who will then contact the proper authority for investigation or testing. Then if we continue to see the same sorts of flags, we continue to document and report. Sometimes things get resolved and everyone is happy, sometimes they do not.

Now if you're talking about red flags as to a student potentially harming themselves or possibly others, we see a lot of false flags all the time. I work with middle school kids; it used to be if one of them drew a picture of a gun in a notebook, we had to report it. But these days, my kids all play Call of Duty and GTA5, so most of the time these drawings or even fantasies they might write about are simply based from the violence they see in video games. But believe me, we do keep an eye on everything. We'll call home to parents and talk to counselor's if we're worried about something, but most of the time it's innocent. 

That being said, I have had several students who....concerned me. I had a boy in one class who had been threatening students when teachers weren't around. A call home revealed that not only was he a foster child, but he had been torturing his other foster siblings and even lighting small fires in his house. We eventually, after a lot of hoops jumped through with CPS and the family, got him the help he needed and he was institutionalized. 

I also had a girl who would be considered Goth by  most standards. Lots of black, heavy makeup, obsession with Edgar Allen Poe. She had a strange habit of bringing cupcakes or cookies into class, sharing them and then watching people eat them but never eating them herself. We had a couple one on one writing sessions and I discovered that her home life was in upheaval because her parents were in the process of a divorce. I'm assuming when she watched other kids eat, she was hoping for praise from them that she wasn't receiving at home. All in all she was a weird, but good kid. 

I was lucky enough to work in a district that really emphasized mental health, so our kids felt comfortable talking to counselors, administrators, teachers and their parents about what was bothering them.

Had a kid I taught in preschool who would get unreasonably angry, violent, and loud for no obvious reason. Everything would be fine and then he would totally snap. All we could do when he did was to usher other kids away and wait for him to calm down. 

His mom seemed nice enough when I met her and his dad didn't appear to be in the picture (he never showed up, was never discussed by mom or child, etc.) One day, mom didn't show to pick him up. I was the only teacher left, since he was the last kid, and he just sat at the window, sobbing.

She didn't show up until 7pm that night and our building closed at 5:30pm. By that time, he was completely inconsolable and it was all I could to do run down to the kitchen with him, make him a sandwich with the director's permission, and let him watch movies on my phone. 

Over the course of the next few weeks, this started to happen more and no matter how many times the director talked to his mom, she would continue to come late. Then his lunches started to deteriorate and he would come to school hungry, having not been fed breakfast. 

He was only with us for the 3 months between preschool and kindergarten and I have no idea what happened to him, but the director was paying close attention and (luckily) we never saw any physical abuse. I always brought him breakfast and made sure I had an extra sandwich and caprisun for him when I came to work. 

That kid didn't go hungry on my watch.

Poor kid was just being forgotten :/

I taught children with severe behavior disorders in a self- contained room for 15 (yes-15) years. Most will end up with a felony record-which was confirmed when I later taught at a jail and saw a few of them- but a certain few I plan on seeing on the ID channel one of these days.

One of them would poop and hide his poop wherever he could- in his pockets, desk, etc.  He had been sexually abused and gave a really bad vibe towards younger kids ( he was in 5th grade.) Of course the white trash bus driver sat him in the back of the bus with pre-school kids. When I told the bus driver this was a bad idea, she reported me to my principal saying I was badmouthing a student. Needless to say, the student was caught sexually abusing a 3 yr.old girl a couple of years later and now is serving a long felony prison sentence for other abuses he perpetrated once he was 18. The bus driver and I had another run in, but luckily she quit before I did. 

That is just one of 4 stories where the red flag was waving like crazy. May have to share a couple more.

 ===*=== 

I have a story that's perfect for this thread. It's going to be long though and it'll probably get buried.

I'm a 7th grade English teacher. Last year I had a student who I'll call Mark. I knew Mark had a lot of issues before I even met him by just looking at his record. Mark was almost 16, learning disabled, and he had not one but TWO traumatic brain injuries. These injuries are the reason why I believe Mark had no common sense and no filter, but it in no way excuses the events I'm about to describe.

When the year started he was pretty docile and eager to please. However as the year went on he became more aggressive and inappropriate. I'm a young woman and he would frequently stay after class to ask for hugs. I would politely redirect him, but sometimes he would ignore me and I'd have to physically push his hands away. That made me uncomfortable for personal and professional reasons. 

Toward the middle of the year he started "dating" a girl (let's call her Sue) and they had me for the same class period, but they broke up after a few weeks (as middle schoolers often do). After Sue broke up with him Mark became obsessed with her, following her to all of her classes, harassing her on social media and in school... it got to the point where Sue did not feel comfortable coming to my class unless she was literally sitting right next to me at the front of the room. Sue also came late to my class and would wait until after the tardy bell for the next period rang before she'd leave my class to avoid him. This girl was so scared she broke down crying when I told her she had to go to her next class because she was so afraid she'd run into him in the hallways.

I emailed our deans and guidance counselors about Marks harassment and reached out to both Sue's and Marks parents to let them know what was happening. The school established a no-contact contract between them (sort of like a middle school version of a restraining order) and things got a little better for Sue, but Marks inappropriate behavior did not end.

A couple weeks later I was out for a doctor appointment when I get an email from the deans at my school saying Mark has been suspended out of school for a 10 days. A student only gets 10 days OSS if they're about to be expelled, and I was freaking out thinking that he had done something to Sue.

Sue was fine, but Mark, as a "prank", had pulled down the pants and underwear of a kid (I'll call him Ryan) in front of the entire class. From what my students told me the next day Mark was laughing and making vulgar, crude comments about Ryan's private parts, making Ryan run crying from the room. Ryan's parents came in that afternoon raising hell (rightfully so) saying Mark needed to be charged with sexual harassment. 

At this point I'd had enough. I went to the principal directly to write a formal statement detailing Marks escalating pattern of aggressive and inappropriate behavior to ensure his expulsion would go through. (The expulsion process is kind of like a trial and you need lots of documentation to get a kid kicked out school) I told her and the expulsion committee that I didn't think having Mark at our school was safe for the other students. It was a matter of time before Mark seriously hurt someone. On top of that I believe he needed professional help, and I thought being expelled would get him that help because he'd have to attend a much stricter charter school 

Long story short, the committee decided not to expel him. They said it wasn't in Marks best interest. He came back to school after serving his suspension.

Flash forward about a month. One day Mark is absent, which is weird because he's never absent. Later I get an email saying he's transferred to another school in our county. I'm wondering what happened to him, so I reach out to his other teachers to see if they know anything.

What happened was Mark had yet another altercation with a student, this time in art class. Mark was "playing around" with a kid and pushed him into a metal filing cabinet. The back of this kids head went into the corner of the filing cabinet, right at the base of his skull. We (teachers) later found out this injury resulted in irreversible brain damage for this kid. He spent the rest of the year being homeschooled and is still in rehabilitation therapy. Idk if he'll ever attend public school again. After this incident Marks mom immediately transferred him to another school to avoid his expulsion. To my knowledge he's never faced repercussions for what he did.

I was furious. I had said to my principal and argued to the expulsion committee that something like this would happen because Mark had no sense of boundaries and zero disregard for other people's feelings. This poor kids life has been changed forever and I blame their negligence as much as I blame Mark. The writing was on the wall and the people who had the power to stop Mark (and get him help!) ignored it.

Idk where Mark is now. I think one day he'll end up on the news for "accidentally" killing someone.

 ===*=== 

My mom was a 2nd grade teacher and had a little boy in her class that would go full redrum and draw crazy things on his dry-erase board. He would write things like kill with images of dead classmates. Upon asking the student why he was writing these things, he just replied with "she's telling me too." 

The scariest part was the boy was absolutely terrified. He didn't want to write/draw any of these things but felt obligated by this "woman". My mom recommended him for a psyche eval and turns out he had severe schizophrenia. 

 ===*=== 

EDIT: Wow. I've never made a comment that exploded my inbox like this - I am humbled by the comments thanking me, touched by those who said they needed (and particularly those who did not receive) help from their teachers, and feel compelled to keep going - even on the bad weeks. Thank you so much! (And thank you for the gold...)

I'm 'that teacher' students find to discuss their mental health and home life issues with. Possibly due to the subject I teach (Health), but I think it also has something to do with my personality. I only teach 10% of the school, but have spoken one-on-one with probably 60% of the kids at some point. Many of them find themselves crying or just moping outside my classroom, and know that I will speak to them or give them some sort of advice. Every once in a while, I find a kid who takes advantage (if I cry to Miss Z., I don't need to take my maths test), but I can usually suss this out quite quickly. 

Anyway - red flags? This week alone, I've had two cases of self-harm, one child who is afraid to come out as gay to her Evangelical parents, one child kicked out of her home for being gay (in the same class, but two separate days), and a seventeen-year-old who had been starving herself. Last year I 'hosted' a lunch club for my most vulnerable students, including 12 girls recovering from eating disorders, and we would have discussions about futures etc. while I was able to check they were eating. 

Why do I do this? It takes up more than half my time at school. It occasionally undermines my position as their teacher (when the line is blurred because 'teacher' and 'counselor'). But I worry what will happen if the students don't have anyone to talk to. 

Why do I do this? Because my dance teacher was the only person in my life who spotted that I was in an abuse relationship. While he didn't step in and call CPS (in retrospect, he should have), it gave me a bright spot and made me realise that someone cared, and was watching out for me. I do know that I became a teacher in part to help kids in the way I needed help. 

...Aaaaand crying...

 ===*=== 

Once had a parent find out that a) I'm gay, and b) I have some music industry contacts. They immediately offered me " unlimited, unsupervised access" to their 16 year old son in exchange for helping him break into the music business. I was 35.

I reported them immediately.

 ===*=== 

I taught a kid about 15 years ago, who was just a tough kid.  There were times when he wasn't so bad, but he was known around our high school as a troublemaker.  Teachers DREADED having him in their class.  I survived my year with him and we actually parted ways on decent terms.  After high school, I would run into him every now and again, as he was dating the daughter of someone I knew relatively well. I was told that it wasn't a healthy relationship,which didn't really surprise me.
A couple of years later, it's summer vacation and I'm just waking up and turn on the TV.  The big news story is about a police shooting in our town.  The police responded to a domestic violence call, and ended up having to shoot and kill the suspect.  My former student.
A family member later told me what happened.  Neighbors heard screaming and called the police.  Police found the girlfriend, holding their 6 mo. old, cowering in a corner.  He was on the other side of the room, holding a butcher knife.  Police told him to put down the knife, and his last words were, "Okay, I'll put it down.......right after I kill the bitch.", at which point he charged towards his girlfriend with the knife raised, and the police were forced to shoot him.
I can't say I was surprised, but it still made me sad.  Sadder still, the baby grew up emotionally/mentally disturbed, due to all the drugs his mother did during her pregnancy.  Last I heard, she dumped the kid on her parents and is now a stripper in Vegas. 

 ===*=== 

I was grading papers, and one of my students was exhibiting all the red flags that she intended to harm herself in the paper. She had turned it in days previously, and I had seen her looking down that morning, so I rushed her paper down to our school psychiatrist. She moved to pull the student out of class, but she had ditched school halfway through the day. Police were dispatched and caught her literally seconds before she carried out her plan. Thank God I didn't put off grading another day.

 ===*=== 

As an early years teacher the worst thing ive seen is a child trying to "hump" others. For example.

A child bends over, he walks up behind and thrusts into them.

He gets on top of a child and proceeds to hump them.

Generally walking up behind them and weirdly thrusting his pelvis into others. Pinning children down / into corners and doing this

Sweet kid but that behaviour rang alarm bells, i reported it on 3 seperate occasions before a "report" was taken from me and it went (supposedly) further up the chain. Always suspected his "sister" was in fact a young mum as the mother was nowhere to be seen ( i met her twice in 2 years of caring for him.)

EDIT: Forgot to say he once did this to my head. 

 ===*=== 

Teaching a kid right now that one of my colleagues jokingly said about "if anyone is going to shoot up our school, it's that kid". He is rather quiet, looks a little off, and can be out of tune with his social skills. He was tested to have a high IQ but never really shows it, doesn't like anything with more challenge.

In short, something in him raises red flags. He is not angry, sad, evil, nothing like that, it is more as if there is a small black hole in your classroom that sucks up any connection, attention, looks you throw its way.

Hope these red flags turn out to be nothing more than a general uneasy feeling.

ETA: I absolutely did NOT agree with this statement made by my younger colleague and have told him so. I really do not believe this kid would harm anyone on purpose.

 ===*=== 

I taught in a school with a large refugee population. This story is not unique considering that but it did affect me. I had one student who was from the Middle East and vey quickly became one of my (secret) favorites. He was quirky and sly and had a habit of smile broadly and agreeably when he had no idea wtf was going on due to language issues. I noticed he had cuts on his arm and was quick to cover them up and tell me "nothing, nothing, no problem ms" when I asked him what was up. 

I reported it to the social worker there because I wanted to make sure he had access to support. Apparently he was already seeing her and they knew he was struggling. She told me that he had spent the last ten years of his life in a safe house, surrounded by only his sister and mother and occasionally his father. His father had been targeted for working with the US so everyday there was legitimate fear that they would be found an executed. Keep in mind this kid was fifteen, sixteen tops, so the majority of his life was spent concerned he was going to be assassinated with no interaction with the outside world.  Given that, I'm incredibly impressed at how well he was doing. It also explained *a lot* of his social weirdness and obsession with his friends. 

 ===*=== 

I've been a teacher for a lot of middle schools and elementary as well (teaching art, waddup art majors??). Anyway, there was one young man who changed my life on what I thought humanly possible to go through. Deon was his name and since this was during the BIG Deon Sanders hype, he was picked on a lot for basically looking like the opposite of the athletic NFL star.. Deon was one of THE sweetest kids I met, he was a little overweight for his age ( 12yrs old, 230lbs)but it seemed as the school year progressed he also seemed to look gradually thinner. It was odd, most of the time you never see those crazy transformations from fat to skinny unless you teach at High school. 

I remember asking him one day after about 3 months of noticing what was going on and I decided to finally act on what I was feeling. We got talking and I finally asked him 

"So..Deon...how have you lost all this weight?". 

I tried my best not to make it awkward, but as he started telling me how he had done it...I realized it wasn't his decision. I half thought before he was going to say something along the lines of "I just can't handle the bullying.." or " I hate it when they make fun of me..".    That was not the case.

His mother had him on a diet of only celery ever since he first went home and complained about the bullying. He explained how every night his mother would weigh him and if he didn't make the weight goal for that week, she would punish him. It was severe. Anytime he didn't make it, his mother would tie his arms to one end of the bed and each of his legs tied to each corner on the opposite side of the bed. Then, she would begin punching him two times in the gut and one kick to his genitals until he threw up.

Gosh, I just remember listening to all this and I couldn't believe it. I knew his mother from PTA events, she was strict and demanding, but it still it all seemed out of character.. then Deon lifted his shirt showing the dark purple bruse marks all over his stomach.

She ended up going to jail not too long after Deon and I had our conversation. Deon ended up being one of my favorite students and we still talk today, he is actually a student teaching in my class as we speak!

When I was in the high school my brother was bullied a lot. 

He was older than me, in a grade above and I was always protecting him, he's legally blind and walks with a cane, overweight, short. He has high functioning aspergers as well. He means well, but sometimes he does and says very strange things. But he's the funniest and most caring guy I know. And people were shitty to him. 

When I was a sophomore my brother was given a cart with a computer on it for magnification, he was let out of his classes 5 or so minutes before the bells rang so he wouldn't have to fight the "traffic" In the hallways with this admittedly large cart. 

A lot of people didn't know I was his brother, he had longer hair because he was embarrassed of his eyes and tried to cover his glassses with them, he always wore this black leather jacket even if it was 100 degrees out. That same year (10th grade) my brother stopped riding the bus home with me, we were a couple miles from school. The first time scared me to death because we always met at the same place and walked to the bus together. I got home and frantically called my dad at work because I couldn't find him. (Early 2000's, home phones!). He showed up about 20 minutes later drenched in sweat in that same old leather jacket, he decided he was too fat and wanted to walk home to lose weight. I was in sports and thought that was great at first, and offered to go run with him and lift weights. 

He broke my heart daily. He would lift and lift, and run and run. Until he hit muscle failure. Until he couldn't fucking breathe. He'd cry he worked himself so hard. Every. Single. Day. I couldn't fathom why he did this to himself. 

I figured it out about a month later, a kid, well call him T Was heavily bullying him. 

Since my brother was in a grade above we had none of the same classes and the way our classes were set up, and how big our school was, he was usually on the other side of the place. We'd pass occasionally in the hallways. 

One day my brother met me at the new usual spot to walk home and had clearly been crying and refused to tell me why, eventually he did. And I was very angry. I confronted T the next day and him not knowing I was his brother said 

"Why do you give a shit about that retard anyway?" 

I lost it. 

I had a Book in my hand and I threw it in his face, and tackled him. We fell back into the lockers and he hit his head hard. I saw red. Don't remember a thing during, but afterwards I was told I was screaming that if he ever touched him again I'd kill him etc etc. 

I was suspended and Well on my way to getting expelled. My father had a similar, albeit poor reaction to the whole situation when him and his biker buddies ambushed T's dad at a local bar and beat him up. We discovered shortly after from my brother that this had been going on for months. 

T went on to selling drugs and was shot and killed when someone tried to rob him years later. 

My brother with all of this new technology in the world has been developing with the help of company I won't name, surgeries to correct and help those with vision disabilities to adapt and live regular day to day lives. 

He makes more money right now than I will probably ever see. And even though it was a horrible situation and I blame the teachers and the administrators for not recognizing t's bullying of my brother. But I suppose it all worked out in the end. 

 ===*=== 

So, I work in an elementary school in a very rough neighborhood.  It gets way too real all the time.  I think the first time this happened was when I witnessed a group of kindergartners very casually discussing the times they'd seen people get shot.

 ===*=== 

I told my 4th grade students that our class pet had died. One child started laughing uncontrollably. Everyone was super uncomfortable. 

 ===*=== 

My colleague is a speech and language therapist and was working with a child with very poor attendance at appointments and a very poor background. Kid was four years old when she started seeing my friend after her teacher referred her in. The girl had really poor language skills and could barely hold a pen but my colleague noticed her teeth were really really bad and that she drooled a lot. Chatted to mum a bit more about her diet at the next appointment and it turned out the girl wasn't eating solid food. She had only ever been given milk with a bottle.

She was taken into foster care with her little sister not long after that and they will stay in foster care til they're 18. Sadly she had to have most of her baby teeth removed but the couple caring for them are amazing and they're hoping to adopt them both.

I was a special ed para in a tiny, very poor rural school. The SpED department was stretched thin. I was 22, had no training, and barely made minimum wage. They were excited to hire me because I, unlike many of the staff, had a bachelor's degree (in an unrelated field). I was NOT equipped in any way to deal with that job or those kids, partially because I was also trying to get myself through what I now recognize as a depressive episode, and mostly because the district didn't have enough resources to give a shit.

This kid David was one of my major responsibilities. He was 14 and couldn't read, so my job was teaching him how to read. I still don't know what his disability was, because the Life Skills teacher was actually a long-term sub and I don't think she knew either, but he was definitely a drug baby and had other issues on top of that. He would have these meltdowns any time I tried to get him to do any work, because his old school just plopped him down in front of the TV instead of trying to work with him. I had to figure out the best way to get him to respond on my own. It was exhausting but we made some decent progress by the end of the school year.

Oh, and he was always masturbating under the table. I didn't know how the fuck to respond to that, like I said I had no training and wasn't given any warning or guidance on how to help this kid. The Life Skills teacher gave him a Serious Talk about how a Grown-Up Young Man Does Not Behave In Public and I think got the principal involved as well, and he improved.

Later in the year he was in an ATV wreck and lost the tip of one finger. He was pretty wrecked after that, and we found out that his parents were giving him fucking oxycodone (which his doctor did NOT give him). He would be sleeping on the couch in the Life Skills room and he cried whenever we tried to wake him or get him to do any school work. On top of that, some older kid pushed him into a row of lockers and hurt his finger again, and he didn't want to tell us what happened or if he was being repeatedly bullied.

Fuck that job, fuck that school, fuck that entire district, fuck that kid's parents. I only stayed for the one school year and I felt bad for leaving him, because I'd gotten kind of attached to him and he actually started to make progress when I was helping him, but they cut the paras' pay shortly before the end of the school year and that was the last straw. I hope he's all right.

My aunt is a teacher, she worked at a school where there were many of low income students. She was teaching a class of first graders a few years ago and there was a little boy who would frequently ask to go to the restroom. After a while, she got suspicious that the kid either had a physical problem or was trying to get out of doing school work. She sent the boy to the nurse, the nurse said that he was fine and was probably faking it to get out of class. She told the little boy that he wasn't allowed to go to the restroom anymore. This made him upset, the kid started yelling when she didn't let him go to the restroom. She called the parents in for a conference. The little boy fessed up in front of his parents about why he kept wanting to go to the restroom. Apparently, this family was so poor that they didn't even have a toilet in their home, the boy said that he would go to flush the toilet and watch the water whirl. The kid was fascinated by a toilet flush...really made me appreciate the little things.

 ===*=== 

Lots of the usual about abuse, mental illness, poverty, etc.

The one a lot of folks may not know about is the phone numbers.  If a parent can't be bothered to keep a way to contact them updated with the school, we're going to be dealing with a headache of a student for the year.

 ===*=== 

I used to work in a high school in the England about 14 years ago, I taught a small class of 15-20 students at age 15-16z One of them, let's call him K got on with everyone. Not popular but he could easily talk to everyone unlike most teenagers. He was a pretty witty kid, very sarcastic and funny, but one day I notice that he's got bruises on his knuckles. I make not of it but I assume it's nothing bad (which was bad on my part) but then he comes to lessons with new bruises and cuts on them. I get on well with the students so I decide to ask him to stay a bit after class to see why his knuckles were bruised. He said that because of his parents drug use and absence from his life (they're consistently in and out of prison) he hits the wall to release anger instead of hitting others. I tell the headmaster but the dickhead passes it off as nothing. The next lesson with him one of the others starts annoying him so he ask to go to the toilet. He comes back with bloody knuckles, I go check the toilets and the mirror in there is completely smashed. Eventually he turned to self harm and attempt suicide, that when the headmaster noticed. K got counselling and after I left the job and he left school and college we've kept in contact. He's got a pretty nice life now, with a girlfriend and is expecting a child. He's completely lost contact with his parents and doesn't even know where they live now.



 ===*=== 

Student told me if he failed his class his father would beat him. I asked him how often that happened, and he told me it happened a lot. I asked him what he meant, like spanking of punching, and he made punching motions. I asked him if he thought that was OK and he told me,"yes, my father loves me and wants me to do well. He wants me to be better." We talked through that learning process and asked if he believed it was a good way, he did not. I asked him if he was scared or needed help, he told me he was OK. He was a child, like 8-13 range. I don't really know the extent or if he was exaggerating, but the messed up part is I teach somewhere where everyone beats their kids. It's legal and common practice, parents can do whatever they want to their kids. I talked to my department head and they were waiting for me to tell them the problem, not even looking at me funny, just not understanding that this was a problem. The kid wasn't the best student and he looked like he wanted to cry when I marked his homework, this led to me finding out why he was scared. I don't see that student anymore. It's weird, people here don't usually talk to their children, the poor don't have the time and have their uneducated parents raise them, the rich hire nannies. A local teacher told me it was good the father was interested. I get that I'm being ethnocentric here, but damn it's hard not to pull a kindergarden cop punch out.  

**TLDR:** Students looked like he was about to cry and pass out, was scared his father would beat him.

Poor hygiene always makes me wonder what the home life is like. I mean, some 14 year olds just stink. But when their hair is consistently greasy, teeth unbrushed, dirty and long fingernails, makes your heart break a little.

 ===*=== 

Kid in grade 1 had intentions of killing people and burning the school down. Not too sure how serious he was, I know he has older siblings but they weren't trouble makers. When other students started passing the word around he was gonna do these things the school eventually expelled him 

EDIT: grammar 

EDIT 2: I don't know all the details of him being expelled, I do know his brother left the school a few years later (wasn't expelled). Haven't seen or heard of him since he was a little boy. 

 ===*=== 

Student who told  teacher he would F*ck her up and piss on her.

and on and on

Twenty years ago I had a kid in my kindergarten class that kicked my hamster.  It was in one of those plastic ball things.  He was a mean angry kid.  He is in jail now.  Sadly you could see it coming even then.

Kid in elementary school who is just so ANGRY. All the time, for no reason. He doesn't seem to feel any empathy for others. He saw another kid crying because they were upset about something and he just sat there smiling. I was giving a lesson one day and he walked over to ask a question (as I'm giving the class instructions) and I asked him to sit down and I'd help him in just a minute. He stomped back to his seat yelling about how he hates me and this school because no one cares and we're all useless. This is a nearly daily occurrence. If you tell him he has to do something he doesn't want to do, he will yell, throw things and generally just melt down. He can't deal with life in a typical way. He always seems to be scowling. I feel bad for him because it has to be hard to be him.

 ===*=== 

Red flag: he said, "one day I'm going to be on the news for going to jail."

Years later: he was on the news, going to jail on major drug offenses.

His freshman year, he made that statement to many teachers. He kept talking about how things were different in his neighborhood and that's all he was going to get out of life. Everybody had tried to help him, and it still wasn't enough.

I once had a student for my physics class a few years back. She would always come to class and just fall asleep (this was AP physics, people falling asleep was pretty rare in my experience) and wake up five to ten minutes after class. Now I always tell my students they're free to stay during lunch period if they feel and so I always have a few who do, mostly LGBT students (I'm the GSA coordinator) so it wasn't weird to me she stayed after class. I eventually had to talk with her because she was failing my class (surprisingly only because she never turned in homework, she got nearly perfect scores on all her tests) and I urged her to transfer to honors or reg because there was much less homework and she'd be able to pass even if she never turned in any of it. She literally looked at me with this blank stare for a good 15 seconds and started balling, her parents died at the beginning of the school year and her older brother didn't make enough to buy her school supplies, he worked two minimum wage jobs and dropped out of uni to take care of her. I ended up secretly changing all her missing work to 50s and giving her a large notebook with a few pens, she passed with an A, the next year she graduated at the top of her class and got a full ride to USF, in her graduation speech she thanked me and I'd never felt more like I had truly done my job as a teacher than in that moment, I also have never hated Common Core more, because I wasn't allowed to exempt her from homework anymore (before common core you were allowed to exempt students from homework, and I normally did so for my homeless/foster care kids or if they had an IEP and the parents told me they had trouble with turning in work, common core doesn't allow you to do this anymore and it's mostly bullshit)

**Addendum**: Common Core is not the direct reason I (in my district) cannot exempt students from homework, Common Core has prompted supers to push for rules that seem on paper like they would increase test scores and make better sheep drones and the difference in these rules is possibly huge, but all have the same purpose.

I was a preschool teacher at a day care center, had 16 students in my classroom and no assistant. I had 5 student with severe emotional issues, 3 of them were foster kids. One of them started school mid-year, he broke my heart. He had just been taken away from his parents, and he was very angry. For the first few weeks, he would run around the classroom knocking things off the shelves and hitting and scratching anyone who tried to stop him. Eventually he accepted being in the class, but he didn't like joining in regular classroom activities and he'd just do his own thing. I let him do his own thing mostly, but was always warm and welcoming to him. He warmed up to me and started trusting me eventually, he hated when other teachers would take over for me when my shift was over. It was always hard to leave at the end of the day because he would cry and hold on to my leg. But the worst was nap time. He hated nap time, but it was the policy that all children must have 2 hours of quiet time. This was also my designated planning and cleaning time, so I really needed all the kids to sleep so I could do other things. At first I let the kid just hang out with me, but he would make noise and wake the other students and eventually they refused to go to sleep. So I started laying down on the carpet with him and patting his back and try to lull him to sleep. He would sob, but he'd stay there as long as I patted his back and he'd eventually fall asleep. One time he fell asleep he started crying and talking in his sleep.... chilled me to my soul. He was saying "no, don't hurt her! Stop you're hurting me! Don't hurt her! Don't use the knife!" He woke up crying and thrashing. All I could think of was to hold him on my lap and give him cuddles until he calmed down. 
That was 2 years ago. I no longer work at that day care, and I don't know what happened to him. I think his foster family was ok, his foster mother was always sweet and kind to him around me.
